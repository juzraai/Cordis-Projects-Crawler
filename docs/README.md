# Crawler for CORDIS projects

*Version:* **2.0-SNAPSHOT** &middot; *Author:* Zsolt Jur√°nyi ([web][www], [github][github])

---

## What's this?

This is a small and easy-to-use command line utility which can help you **grab [CORDIS][cordis] projects' information automatically,** along with related publications from [OpenAIRE][oaa]. You tell the program which projects you are interested in, and the software downloads the files which contain the required data. It can parse them and generate [TSV][tsv] or MySQL export.



## How to use it?

See the [User guide](USER_GUIDE.md).



## What's new in version 2?

* I rebuilt the crawler from scratch, switched from Java to [Kotlin][kotlin].
* Extracts data from CORDIS XMLs and OpenAIRE API instead of messy HTML pages and encoded JSON strings.
* Can parse information of all projects, from oldest to newest.
* There are [new ways to tell](USER_GUIDE.md#seed) the crawler which projects are needed.
* [Modular architecture](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#modules) helps developers to extend/alter functionality of the crawler.
* Sexy documentation using [Docsify][docsify]



## Future plans, ideas

* Option to modify chunk size (`-b` ?), request sleeps (`-z` ?)
* Seed and export: RCN list file
* Crawl project documents (`webItem`) with option `-d`
* Crawl result XMLs with option `-r`
* Generate "unified view" export (with option `-u` maybe)
