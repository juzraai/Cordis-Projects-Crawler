# Crawler for CORDIS projects

The old [v1.3.0](https://github.com/juzraai/cordis-projects-crawler/releases/tag/v1.3.0) is not working anymore on the updated CORDIS website.

**Currently, I'm working on [v2.0](https://github.com/juzraai/cordis-projects-crawler/tree/v2) and I will update master branch when some features are ready to use. The [documentation](https://juzraai.github.io/cordis-projects-crawler) can inform you about the progress.**
