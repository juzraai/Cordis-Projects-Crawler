# Contribution guide

Whether you'd like to

please **read this page till the end first**, then follow these simple rules, instructions when you contribute to this project.

Any contribution is appreciated. :)



## Common steps

### Step 1: Search

Please search through existing issues and pull requests to find out whether your issue is mentioned before. If it was, please leave a comment on the existing ticket instead of creating a new one.

### Step 2: Describe

Whether you are opening a ticket (just asking, reporting, requesting) or a pull request (providing code modification), please:

* Add the proper label: `question`, `bug` or `feature`
* Summarize the issue **in a few words** in the title.
* Give details about the issue in the description.

### Step 3: Verify

Please find the right scenario below and verify your issue or pull request **before submitting it**.



## Scenarios


### Question

**Do you have a question?**

Please use the `question` label.



### Bug report

**Have you found a bug?**

Please use the `bug` label and include the following in the description:

* JRE version (output of `java -version` command)
* Software version (which [release](https://github.com/juzraai/cordis-projects-crawler/releases) you had downloaded)
* Software configuration (arguments)
* Steps to reproduce the problem
* **What did you expect** the software to do
* **What the software actually did** instead
* Stack trace (exceptions) or error messages, if any



### Bug fix

**Have you found a bug and implemented its fix in your fork?**

Please act like [you've found a bug](#bug-report), and additionally include in the pull request description, **how did you fix** the bug (e.g. what caused the bug, how did you solve it).

Please ensure your code parts **follow the conventions** you see in the main repository (indentation, naming, etc.).



### Idea

**Do you have an idea/request of a new feature?**

Please use the `feature` label and include the following in the description:

* What problem this feature would solve (e.g. who needs it and why)
* How would it solve it
* **How do you imagine using the feature** (e.g. CLI configuration, output format)


### Improvement

**Have you implemented an improvement or a new feature?**

Please do as [you have an idea](#idea) first and

* Include **how did you implement** the improvement/feature
* Update the documentation too in your pull request

Please ensure your code parts **follow the conventions** you see in the main repository (indentation, naming, etc.).

As Kotlin is a very young language in opposite to the good old and very popular Java, **I accept new features as Java classes too.**



### Newbie

**Do you want to contribute to this project, but you lack ideas?**

Please see the [good first issues](https://github.com/juzraai/cordis-projects-crawler/labels/good%20first%20issue) list and if you feel like solving one of them, feel free to do it! :)
